Sudoku solver for Good Sudoku on iPhone Game Center
Main application will be in Python, with possible expansion to other languages where needed.

Current Plan for development:
The software will be comprised of 3 parts:

	1. Sudoku Solver:
			v1 Brute Force
			v2 Uses tecniques as per the Good Sudoku+ app

	2. Sudoku Speed Solving:
			objective: Given the solution (provided by part 1) provide quickest way to solve it.
			context: Good Sudoku+ has the option to autofill the cells that have one option left in the 3x3 square once you have inserted a number in one of these cells.

	3. iPhone implementation:
			objective: implement the solver and speed solver, to:
                                 1. Obtain the 365 streak, by using an exploit
                                 2. Subsequently, implement a program to obtain as many gold as possible. 
                                            (two accounts needed, on to have the speed solution and the other to achieve the golds)

The only objective that I want to achieve is the 365 streak. The rest is only correllary (and not obligatory) or functional to this objective.
The other motivation for the program is to practice my coding.
